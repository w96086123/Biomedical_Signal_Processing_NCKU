function [I, Is, p] = mutingsig(x,y,Ns,g_flag)
% [I, Is, p] = mutingsig(x,y,Ns,g_flag);
% Calculates the mutual information I between vectors x and y which 
% take on continuous values, but is quantised by partitioning data to 
% produce an equal number of data poits in each bin.
% Ns permutated surrogates are used to calculate values Is and the 
% significance probability level p that Is < I.
% Use Ns = 19 for 95% and Ns = 99 for 99% (one-sided hypothesis test)
% graphics off (g_flag=0) by default, else plot on figure(ceil(g_flag))
